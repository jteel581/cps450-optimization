### Phase 5 Optimization 

#### Time Spent: 30 hours
#### Level Attempted B level 
 - (Implimented all of C level, and multiple user defined classes, dynamically allocated memory for instance variables, object instantiation, null, and me expressions)
#### DID NOT DO: run time null pointer exceptions, support for string types
#### Known Bugs: 
	- My program does not use the stdlib.floyd file since I do not support strings so some tests for the B version may not come out correct, but the object instantiation test file does pass. 
	- In addition, some error messages may not be entirely accurate because I do not support strings and run time null pointer exceptions, in these cases, the error message usually says it is a feature unsuported error. 
	- Also, my compiler has trouble with call statements in lines such as " class.method1().method2().method3() " 
	- Finally, I think I removed all null pointer exceptions, so even though a test may fail, it should exit with errors printed on the screen and not crash because of them. 
		- I tested with all available tests for the A leve, B level, and C level. 
			- C level tests all passed, however when using IO redirection, the cgcd program output by my compiler did not output the correct number, but when typing the numbers in it did work. That was the only C level test that I had that issue with. 
			- As for the B level tests, the only one that passed was the bobjbasics.floyd file. 
			- The rest were not supported, as were the tests from the A level.
